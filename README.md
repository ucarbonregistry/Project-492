_______________

Collection of solid waste is done by the Nashik Municipal Corporation. Nashik Waste Management Pvt Limited
(NWMPL) receives this solid waste (SW) from its management and further processing is done by NWMPL. The partial
biodegradable component of mixed Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is aerobically treated in a compost plant section to
produce compost to be used in agriculture, and the leachate from the waste is anaerobically treated for energy recovery
or biogas production. The partial-biodegradable/combustible component is further processed to make Refuse-Derived
Fuel (RDF) to be used in boilers and incinerator CPA.

The plastic collected from dry waste is converted into fuel and part of it goes into Material Recovery Facility (MRF).
The horticulture waste is used to manufacture biomass briquettes. Waste with a high organic pollution load that is
leachate is converted into biogas ie. methane. The rejects go into a scientific landfill (SLF). The roof of the SLF is
covered with plantation. Biomining targeted legacy waste from open landfills that have existed since 2000. Through
biomining, materials were repurposed, and landfill space was reclaimed. The Dead Animal Carcass Incinerator
processes dead animal carcasses using Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF), plastic-to-fuel, and electricity generated from the
biogas plant.

Installed solar panels on the site provide electricity to the plant, and are connected to the MSEB grid through a solar net
metering system that allows for a "give and take" arrangement.

There is also a proposed action plan for a bamboo plantation on the site and will be registered with the CDM later for a
carbon capture CPA.

Purpose of the project activity:
Despite the Government of India's efforts to promote efficient waste management technologies and the Waste
Management Rules, the compliance rate remains poor and there is no documented compliance rate in government
literature. Calculations from CPCB documents give the amount of waste collected and processed, using this to calculate
the compliance rate, 20.18% rate shows for 2017 when the project became operational. Currently it is 53.72%, however
this is not an evidence based number. The common practice is still of disposing MSW in landfills. In growing urban
areas, the management of municipal solid waste (MSW) poses a significant environmental concern.
The disposal of MSW, often in landfills, contributes to the emission of harmful gases like methane, carbon dioxide, and
nitrous oxide further worsening air quality and accelerating climate change.

To address these pressing environmental challenges, the primary objective is to establish an integrated MSWM plant.
This system aims to scientifically process the waste and efficiently utilise all its components, including biodegradable
materials, RDF, inerts, and leachate. By doing so, we aim to minimize Methane and Carbon Dioxide emissions by
processing and scientifically disposing all the MSW of Nashik city which will mitigate the adverse environmental
impact associated with open dumping of MSW.


Before the implementation of Nashik Waste Management Private Limited (NWMPL) in 2017, the Municipal Solid
Waste in Nashik was dumped in unsanitary landfills outside the city. The methane that was being released from the
open waste would catch fire by afternoon. Hence there was release of methane and carbon dioxide, the two most
hazardous greenhouse gases responsible for global warming. This led to significant environmental damage to air, soil
and water posing risk to both the environment and public health.

The MSW processing Plant was having a processing capacity of 500 Tons/day in 2017 and this has been augmented to
an aggregate capacity to process 800 Tons/day in 2024, which is increased up to 1100 TPD during festivities.
The main purpose is to avoid methane and carbon dioxide emission through:

• Composting and Compost Manufacturing - Biodegradable municipal solid waste is processed in a compost plant
using controlled aerobic decomposition. The windrow composting method is employed for this process. In
windrow composting, organic materials are arranged in long rows called windrows. This method facilitates the
efficient breakdown of waste. The result is nutrient-rich compost that supports soil health. It also reduces the need
for chemical fertilizers. Additionally, this process helps divert organic materials from landfills. As a result, methane
emissions are significantly reduced.

• Biomass Briquettes - Biomass briquettes are produced from horticulture waste. These briquettes serve as an
alternative to fossil fuels, providing a renewable source of energy. This process not only reduces waste but also
lowers carbon dioxide emissions by replacing coal.

• Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) Plant - The non-biodegradable portion of MSW is processed to manufacture RDF,
which is used for generating electricity or supplied to various facilities as a source for thermal energy or electricity,
replacing coal. This process reduces the volume of waste destined for landfills and provides an alternative energy
source.

• Plastic to Fuel - This method involves converting plastic waste into fuel, addressing the issue of plastic pollution
and reducing carbon emissions. By transforming plastic into a useful resource, the process mitigates the
environmental impact of plastic waste. This reduces the plastic pollution and provides an alternative non fossil fuel.

• Leachate to Gas - In the leachate to gas process, waste with a high organic pollution load is converted into biogas.
This biogas is then used as a fuel, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, the biogas is converted into
electricity for captive consumption, offering a sustainable energy solution. This process not only generates power
but also supports environmental sustainability by providing an alternative to conventional energy sources.

• Dead Animal Carcass Incinerator - This incinerator processes dead animal carcasses with a capacity of 300 kg per
hour. The use of diesel has been replaced by Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) and plastic-based fuel, reducing the
carbon footprint and managing waste more effectively. It also takes care of the hazardous waste.

• Biomining of Legacy Waste - Biomining targeted legacy waste from open landfills that had existed since 2000. This
process involved excavating and processing waste to separate and recycle valuable materials. The project spans 9
acres and was scheduled to last 60 months. Through biomining, materials were repurposed, and landfill space was
reclaimed.

• Scientific Landfill (SLF) - The inerts from biomining of legacy waste and the inerts from daily MSW are disposed
of in the sanitary landfill created for this purpose. This prevents the release of harmful gases into the atmosphere.

• Solar Energy –The integration of solar energy harnesses the power of the sun to generate clean electricity. This
renewable energy source reduces dependence on fossil fuels and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. This dual
approach—managing solid waste and harnessing solar power—demonstrates a comprehensive strategy to reduce
carbon footprints and contribute to India's renewable energy targets. The NWMPL plant has recently installed solar
panelling which reduces the dependence on energy produced by fossil fuel.
